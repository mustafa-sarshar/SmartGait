## About this directory:
### This directory contains all models trained for SmartGait_01 and sample Python codes to run and evaluate each model.

1) SmartGait_01.py: please run this file and define the gait phase as a command line argument, if you want to separately test and evaluate each model.
- run: python SmartGait_01.py [enter the gait phase name]
- example: python SmartGait_01.py MidSwing


2) SmartGait_01_allModels.py: please run this file, if you wish to run all the models and compare their performance together.
- run: python SmartGait_01_allModels.py
