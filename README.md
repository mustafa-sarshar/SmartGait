# SmartGait
Gait Phase Estimation by employing Artificial Intelligence

This project aims to pave the way in IMU-based gait phase estimation by employing the state-of-the-art technology, in particular deep learning algorithms.

The repository consists of final files, which you can see in the root directory of the repo, and a fully described from-scratch section for each model, if any one would like to create these models on his/her own.

Moreover, the project will grow it selft step-by-step, therefore more trained models will be presented in this repo in the future.
At this moment, the first SmartGait model, "SmartGait_01" is already trained, which is still not a completed trained model for production, however, it is a proof of our concept in using LSTM model to estimate three main gait phases, MidSwing, FootOff and FootContact.
