# SmartGait
Gait Phase Estimation by employing Artificial Intelligence

This project aims to pave the way for the development of IMU-based gait phase estimation by employing the state-of-the-art technology, in particular deep learning algorithms.

This repository consists of:
1) "Trained_models" directory, please check use_trained_models directory.
2) "Create_models_from_scratch" directory, for those who would like to create these models on their own.

Moreover, the project will grow itselft step-by-step, therefore more trained models will be presented in this repo in the future.
At this moment, the first SmartGait model, "SmartGait_01" is already trained, which is still not a completed trained model for production, however, it is a proof of our concept in using LSTM algorithm to estimate three main gait phases, MidSwing, FootOff and FootContact.
